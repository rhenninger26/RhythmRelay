# RhythmRelay
A radio and faux record player arduino project. The "records" have RFID stickers that connect to Spotify playlists.
# RhythmRelay

A unique blend of retro and modern technology, combining a traditional radio and record player interface with modern streaming capabilities.

### Description

RhythmRelay is a capstone project that transforms reclaimed components into a hybrid radio/record player using Arduino. The device features:

- Functional FM radio with tuning and volume controls
- Record player mode activated by RFID-enabled cards
- LED display showing radio frequency or playlist information
- Mechanical record arm that doubles as a mode switch
- Integration with music streaming services

### Hardware Components

The project utilizes:

- Arduino
- FM radio module
- RFID scanner
- LCD display screen
- Reclaimed speakers and potentiometers

### Project Timeline

Development is organized into sprints:

- Sprint 1: Box Construction (Mar 21 - Apr 8)
- Sprint 2: Hardware Setup (Apr 9 - Apr 22)
- Sprint 3: FM Radio Development (Apr 23 - May 6)
- Sprint 4: Record Mode Implementation (May 7 - May 20)
- Sprint 5: Final Integration (May 21 - May 29)
